# Troubleshooting

## Basics

 - Have you searched [known issues]?
 - Is your computer powered on?
 - Did you read all the items on this page?
 - Then you should contact [support]!

## Bug Reproduction
Running Binary Ninja with debug logging will make your bug report more useful.
```
./binaryninja --debug --stderr-log
```

## License Problems

- If experiencing problems with Windows UAC permissions during an update, the easiest fix is to completely un-install and [recover][recover] the latest installer and license. Preferences are saved outside the installation folder and are preserved, though you might want to remove your [license](/getting-started/index.html#license).
- If you need to change the email address on your license, contact [support].

## Linux

Given the diversity of Linux distributions, some work-arounds are required to run Binary Ninja on platforms that are not [officially supported][faq].

### Headless Ubuntu

If you're having trouble getting Binary Ninja installed in a headless server install where you want to be able to X-Forward the GUI on a remote machine, the following should meet requiremetns (for at least 14.04 LTS):

```
apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx libfontconfig1 libxrender1 libegl1-mesa libxi6 libnspr4 libsm6
```

### Arch Linux

 - Install python2 from the [official repositories][archrepo] (`sudo pacman -S python2`) and create a sym link: `sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so.1.0 /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so.1`
 - Install the [libcurl-compat] library with `sudo pacman -S libcurl-compat`, and run Binary Ninja via `LD_PRELOAD=libcurl.so.3 ~/binaryninja/binaryninja`

### KDE

To run Binary Ninja in a KDE based environment, set the `QT_PLUGIN_PATH` to the `QT` sub-folder:

```
cd ~/binaryninja
QT_PLUGIN_PATH=./qt ./binaryninja
```


## API

 - If the GUI launches but the license file is not valid when launched from the command-line, check that you're using the right version of Python. Only a 64-bit Python 2.7 is supported at this time. Additionally, the [personal][purchase] edition does not support headless operation.
