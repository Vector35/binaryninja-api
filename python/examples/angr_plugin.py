# This plugin assumes angr is already installed and available on the system. See the angr documentation
# for information about installing angr. It should be installed using the virtualenv method.
#
# This plugin is currently only known to work on Linux using virtualenv. Switch to the virtual environment
# (using a command such as "workon angr"), then run the Binary Ninja UI from the command line.
#
# This method is known to fail on Mac OS X as the virtualenv used by angr does not appear to provide a
# way to automatically link to the correct version of Python, even when running the UI from within the
# virtual environment. A later update may allow for a manual override to link to the required version
# of Python.
