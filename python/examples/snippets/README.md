# Snippet UI Plugin (v1.5)
Author: **Vector 35 Inc**

_Powerful code-editing plugin for writing and managing python code-snippets with syntax highlightingd, hotkey binding and other features_

## Description:

The snippet editor started as a simple example UI plugin to demonstrate new features available to UI plugins. It has turned into a functionally useful plugin in its own right. The snippet editor allows you to write small bits of code that might not be big enough to warrant the effort of a full plugin but are longer enough that you don't want to retype them every time in the python-console!

As an added bonus, all snippets are added to the snippets menu and hot-keys can be associated with them as they make use of the action system. All action-system items are also available through the command-palette (CTL/CMD-p).
